# Images

I made a Google Photos album with some images: https://photos.app.goo.gl/HazGuVjcKbjbDgfe6

Included are pictures and videos of:
- waveform for SPI which was a single clock edge off
- matrix example display
- wiring
- picture with blue pixels in a pattern: the matrix was actually supposed to be showing
my IMU data in binary in white pixels, still not really sure how it became blue
- routing algorithm taking over 30 minutes
- partial demo with peripheral particles flashing around and freaking out
- final demo where i move around a blob
