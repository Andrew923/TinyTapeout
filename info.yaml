# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  title:        "Soft Body Physics Simulator"
  description:  "Based on accelerometer readings, simulates physics of a soft-body object and displays on WS2812 matrix"
  how_it_works: "Takes in input from an accelerometer through SPI communication. These external forces drive the internnal representation of a few particles connected by spring forces. THe output is driven to an LED matrix using the WS2812 protocol."
  how_to_test:  "Run CocoTB tests. Many are simply for viewing waveforms. Test on FPGA for full integration."
  external_hw:  "Requires an ISM330DHCX imu and 16x16 WS2812 LED matrix"
  language:     "verilog"
